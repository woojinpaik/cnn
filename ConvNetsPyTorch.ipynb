    "\n",
    "Computer vision is different from generic classification, because when we are trying to find a certain object in the picture, we are scanning the image looking for some specific **patterns** and their combinations. For example, when looking for a cat, we first may look for horizontal lines, which can form whiskers, and then certain combination of whiskers can tell us that it is actually a picture of a cat. Relative position and presence of certain patterns is important, and not their exact position on the image. \n",

    "To extract patterns, we will use the notion of **convolutional filters**. But first, let us load all dependencies and functions that we have defined in the previous units."

    "Convolutional layers are defined using `nn.Conv2d` construction. We need to specify the following:\n",
    "* `in_channels` - number of input channels. In our case we are dealing with a grayscale image, thus number of input channels is 1.\n",
    "* `out_channels` - number of filters to use. We will use 9 different filters, which will give the network plenty of opportunities to explore which filters work best for our scenario.\n",
    "* `kernel_size` is the size of the sliding window. Usually 3x3 or 5x5 filters are used.\n",

    "Simplest CNN will contain one convolutional layer. Given the input size 28x28, after applying nine 5x5 filters we will end up with a tensor of 9x24x24 (the spatial size is smaller, because there are only 24 positions where a sliding interval of length 5 can fit into 28 pixels).\n",
    "\n",
    "After convolution, we flatten 9x24x24 tensor into one vector of size 5184, and then add linear layer, to produce 10 classes. We also use `relu` activation function in between layers. \n",

    "Non-linear: While it looks like a linear function, ReLU introduces a non-linearity (a simple threshold at 0), which allows models to learn more complex patterns.\n",
    "Computationally Efficient: It is very efficient to compute as it only requires checking if the input is positive or not.\n",
    "Sparse Activation: In practice, ReLU results in sparse activations; i.e., only a subset of neurons in a layer are active at a given time."
